Day 1 reflection

Difficulty of determining algorithm: 2/10

This is a problem i have seen multiple times in the past. I knew a O(n) time complexity. 


Code value: Code needs to be more prepared for change. Use of languages 

Overall notes: Good first challenges, while not compiling. Good test of skills and introduction
